If you identify a potential security issue in ShieldUp:

1. Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly or in a GitHub issue.
2. Email the project maintainer directly at:

   Subject: ShieldUp Security Vulnerability Report

3. In your report, please include the following:
   - Affected screen, service, or feature
   - Steps to reproduce the vulnerability
   - Any relevant code snippets, screenshots, or logs
   - A clear explanation of the risk or potential impact

We aim to respond to all security reports within 72 hours and to resolve issues as quickly and safely as possible.

Responsible Disclosure

We appreciate the efforts of ethical hackers and researchers who report vulnerabilities responsibly. By reporting issues privately, you help us protect users and maintain the integrity of the project.
